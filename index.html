        </header>
        <p class="paragraph">The following is a brief overview of the basic principles of the physics of space. I have written this out in a way that should make these complex topics easier to understand for the purpose of personal knowledge development and understanding.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">These sections and their topics tie together, creating the foundational knowledge for understanding the complexities of the universe and creation in it's entirety. They have been theories built over time by some of the most brilliant minds in the history of physics. As a society, we are still broadening our knowledge to better understand each theory. With every development we are often left with more questions than answers. It is an ever-growing mystery that leaves scientics in awe of what is and what is to come.</p>

        <h2>Special Relativity</h2>
    </header>
    <p class="paragraph">Special Relativity is the notion set forth by Albert Einstein that the velocity of an object is relative to the motion of the object(s) around it. There is only one type of motion in the universe that travels at a consistant rate, which is the speed of light. All other objects are traveling at a rate only measurable in comparison to their environment.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">For example, a seemingly motionless object sat upon a shelf would be described by an observer as not moving. Yet, its true velocity exists, just not in comparison to other objects. This is because the Earth is in contant motion, making all objects on the planet travel throughout the universe.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Another classic example of Special Relativity could be observed within a car traveling down a highway. If the driver was to toss a pen to the backseat passenger, the pen looks to only be moving at a couple of miles per hour. Yet, because the pen is traveling at the same velocity of the car until it is thrown to the back, it travels faster than the car for a moment. The passengers in the car only observe the difference in speed between themselves and the pen, yet someone standing on the side of the road who witnesses the event would see the pen travel through the air at a much faster rate.</p>
